## What You Can Do with Your API Key

### ‚úÖ Single Key = Access to All Businesses
```python
# One API key works for ALL businesses
analyzer = YelpReviewAnalyzer()

# Analyze any business on Yelp
businesses_to_analyze = [
    "starbucks_business_id",
    "mcdonalds_business_id", 
    "pizza_hut_business_id",
    "any_restaurant_business_id"
]

for business_id in businesses_to_analyze:
    results = analyzer.analyze_business_reviews(business_id)
    print(f"Analysis complete for {business_id}")
```

### ‚úÖ Find Business IDs
```python
from utils import search_businesses

# Search for any business
businesses = search_businesses("Starbucks", "New York, NY")
print(f"Found {len(businesses)} Starbucks locations")

# Get business ID from search results
business_id = businesses[0]['id']
```

## API Usage Limits

### Free Tier Limits
- **500 requests per day**
- **5 requests per second**

### Your System Handles This
- ‚úÖ **Automatic delays** between API calls
- ‚úÖ **Rate limit compliance** built-in
- ‚úÖ **Error handling** for limits
- ‚úÖ **Efficient caching** to minimize requests

## Testing Your API Key

### Test 1: Basic Connection
```python
from utils import search_businesses

# Test with a simple search
businesses = search_businesses("Starbucks", "New York, NY")
if businesses:
    print("‚úÖ API key is working!")
    print(f"Found {len(businesses)} businesses")
else:
    print("‚ùå API key not working or no results")
```

### Test 2: Full Analysis
```python
from yelp_analyzer import YelpReviewAnalyzer

analyzer = YelpReviewAnalyzer()
# Use a business ID from your search
results = analyzer.analyze_business_reviews("business_id_here")
print("Analysis complete!")
```
