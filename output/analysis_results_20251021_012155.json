It didn’t taste as if it had been freshly baked that day.\nPerhaps had been previously prepared and refrigerated. The pastry had collected moisture instead of it being flakey and crisp, which indicates pre-refrigeration.\nI guess my standards for a bakery are quite high. Fresh baked goods daily.\n\nThe restaurant.\nEven though the portion size and quality needs improvement….I have to be fair and acknowledge their affordable and reasonable menu pricing. You get what you pay for.\n\nYup. That pretty much sums it up."

I knew I had to try one, although some of the flavors were too sweet for my taste. Still, it was a refreshing discovery that I couldn't resist. I'll definitely stop by again on my next appointment and sample some new pastries. The pastry chef even offered a complimentary bread tasting, fresh from the oven, which was absolutely delicious.",
